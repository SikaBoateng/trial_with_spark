## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation of a data pipeline using Pandas and PySpark for ingesting data into MySQL. The pipeline leverages PySpark's capabilities for handling incremental updates, data transformation, scalability and parallel processing, data storage, and fault tolerance to efficiently manage and process large volumes of data.

## Necessary Libraries, Tools, and Frameworks
- **Python**: Programming language used for scripting and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Python library for data manipulation and analysis, used for handling CSV and JSON files and performing data transformations.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system used for storing the processed data.
- **MySQL Connector**: Python library for connecting to MySQL from Python scripts using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
- **PySpark**: Apache Spark library for big data processing, used for scalability and parallel processing.
- **Git**: Version control system used for managing project codebase.
- **Markdown**: Lightweight markup language used for writing documentation.

## Data Ingestion and Schema Evolution
- Implemented a data ingestion mechanism using Python scripts and Pandas library to load data from both CSV and JSON files.
- Handled schema evolution scenarios by dynamically generating SQL statements to create tables based on the data schema.

## Incremental Updates
- PySpark enables efficient handling of incremental updates by processing only the new or modified records since the last execution. This minimizes processing time and resources required for updating the data in MySQL, ensuring that the pipeline remains responsive and scalable.
- Considered scenarios where data is continuously updated, ensuring efficient processing without reprocessing already processed data.

## Data Transformation
- Utilized Pandas library for data transformations, enriching orders and delivery data with user information and calculating aggregate metrics such as total transaction amount per user. 

## Scalability and Parallel Processing
- The use of PySpark offers scalability by distributing data processing tasks across multiple nodes in a cluster. This enables processing large volumes of data in parallel, significantly reducing processing time. The pipeline can ingest and transform data from multiple sources concurrently, improving throughput and efficiency.
 
## Data Storage
- Chose MySQL as the database solution to store the processed data due to its scalability,  data structure, and query requirements.
- Seamless integration with MySQL was provided through PySpark's DataFrame API, allowing easy writing of PySpark DataFrames to MySQL tables. PySpark optimizes the ingestion process by partitioning the data and executing parallel writes to MySQL, maximizing throughput and minimizing latency. Data consistency and integrity are maintained throughout the storage process.

## Fault Tolerance
- With the use of PySpark, it offered built-in fault tolerance mechanisms, such as RDD lineage and job retry mechanisms, ensuring reliable data processing in the presence of failures. Automatic retries of failed tasks and configurable fault tolerance settings enhance the reliability of the pipeline, ensuring successful ingestion into MySQL without data loss or corruption.

## Documentation
- Includes instructions on how to run and maintain the pipeline, ensuring ease of use and maintenance for future development.

## Running the Pipeline
## Prerequisites
- Python
- Pandas
- MySQL
- Pyspark
- Necessary libraries

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone the repository containing the data pipeline scripts to your local machine.

2. **Execute Data Preparation Scripts**
   - Run the respective `.ipynb` files to update the CSV files with the latest data and save them.

3. **Configure MySQL Connection Parameters**
   - Open the PySpark script (ingestion.ipynb for market1 and market2).
   - Update the MySQL connection parameters within the PySpark scripts to match your MySQL server configuration.

4. **Execute the PySpark Scripts with JDBC**
   - Run the PySpark scripts to ingest and transform data into MySQL using JDBC.
   - These scripts will handle both data ingestion and transformation tasks efficiently using PySpark DataFrame API with JDBC connectivity and will import the data into the corresponding tables in the database.

5. **Monitor Execution**
   - Monitor the execution of the pipeline and handle any errors or exceptions gracefully.
   - Ensure that the data ingestion process completes successfully without any issues.
   - Handle any changes in data schema or requirements by updating the pipeline accordingly.
   - Continuously optimize the pipeline for performance, scalability, and reliability based on evolving needs.
